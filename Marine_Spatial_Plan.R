#Let's order by the 20 most diverse estuaries: 
FishSurvey <- FishSurvey[order(-FishSurvey$Alpha),]

#This gives us the estuaries with the highest species counts 
#Mlalazi is the most diverse 

Alphalist <- FishSurvey[1:20,1]

#Let's plot this though

#Now let's try Colin's way: 
FishSurvey$Alphalist <- 0
FishSurvey$Alphalist[1:20] <- 1
#I don't know man, I think cutting the data is easier and more flexible 

#How many species occur in these top 20 estuaries? 
sum(FishSurvey[1:20,149])
#So the summed alpha is 760 for the 20 most diverse estuaries, but those will be many recounts of the same species 






#Now we have alpha diversity for each estuary

#Shall we try Shannon diversity? 

Shannon <- diversity(FishSurvey[,4:148])
Shannon

FishSurvey$Shannon <- Shannon

#Now let's try for some Beta-diversity: just for the hell of it 

Simpson <- diversity(FishSurvey[,4:148],"simpson")
Simpson

FishSurvey$Simpson <- Simpson

#Now for Simpson's diversity, a low number = high diversity but a high number = low diversity, so should I invert it by subtracting it from 1?
